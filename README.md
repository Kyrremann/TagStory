Tag Story - A INF5162 project
-----------------------------
Tag Story is a project focusing on getting people in all ages out into the woods. This is done by making narrative stories that the user can help to develope by visiting different tags outside.

Better description pending...

Todo
----
* Make web site
 * Let the user make a profile
 * Let the user create stories
* Tags can not be hanged on metal
* Check out what TripAdvisor have done on suggesting routes, maybe we can do something similar

### App
* Get compass to work properly
* User profile and functionality in the application
* Point scoring?
* Better UI for the quizmode. Green when correct, red when you failed
 * Have a small image next to the question, question mark for the current question, 'check' sign for correct, and an 'X' for wrong
* Let the user click and zoom images
* Travel - Let the user move X meters and then "automagically" scan the tag.
* Statestic about where you are on the route, also see where other are
* Scan tags with QR-code or GPS
* Better history of where you are in the story (in case of app failure)
* Send "help" or messages to people on a Story. Similar to Hunger Games
