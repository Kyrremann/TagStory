While the building was under construction, architects went on a study trip to Europe. There was functionalist style that was most modern, and a functionalist façade was build upon it, almost like wrapping paper, drawn over the classical structure. Norway got its first functionalist building of considerable extent. It did not suit taste of the general public - the building was criticized for removing the dignity of the university.",

The first work you encounter is Arnold Shouts Lands (1920-1983) \"Air\". The sculpture was erected in 1962 and was a gift from AS Freia to the universitys 150-year anniversary in 1961.

First, in 2005, the sculpture \"Broken form\" by Aase Texmon Rygh (1925) on the square in front of the Faculty of Humanities. The history of this piece began in 1981 when Texmon Rygh with \"Broken form\" won a closed competition for the decoration of the area at Furuset subway station in Oslo. Years passed and the site was changed.\n\nA similar story for \"Shared form \" by Ervin Løffler (1922) that was made to Romsås school. The sculpture consists of two main forms. These surrounds and interlocking with an inner dynamic that makes the sculpture changes character as one moves around it. This sculpture stands in front Eilert Sundt building and arrived at the place in summer 2010 in cooperation with Oslo and the Norwegian Sculptor Association.",

The project ambitions may be compared with physics building from 1935. The building is an extensive artistic program, with decorations by Bard Breivik, Vibeke Jensen, Tone Myskja, Patrik Entian, Höfflin & Glis Man and Beret Aksnes. There are two work of art here: The sculpture outside, Fractals of Bard, is an artistic interpretation of fractals, as a kind one finds in a snail shell, bacteria and galaxies. The Cube, by Vibeke Jensen, is an interactive eye.\n\nYou have now reached the end of the treasure hunt! You may wonder where the treasure is, but you have already found it by finding the clues. Knowledge is the greatest treasure of them all!",
